# Purgatorio: A Vision for the Game

This document captures the long-term creative vision for transforming this dungeon crawler into a game themed around Catholic purgatory. These changes will be gradual, growing organically over time.

## Core Concept

The player is a soul undergoing purification, ascending through trials toward Heaven. The journey is one of hope—purgatory, unlike hell, is certain of its destination.

## Thematic Elements

### The Journey
- Floors become stages of purification, not just dungeon levels
- Ascending toward the Beatific Vision rather than descending into darkness
- Each floor represents cleansing from specific attachments or venial sins

### The Soul (Player)
- A soul in purgatory, not a generic adventurer
- Stats could reflect virtues (Faith, Hope, Charity, Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, Temperance)
- Growth through purification, not just power accumulation

### Enemies
- Manifestations of the seven capital sins:
  - Pride, Greed, Lust, Envy, Gluttony, Wrath, Sloth
- Demons as tempters and obstacles
- Not killed but "overcome" or "dispelled"

### The Tavern / Rest Area
- Evolve into a chapel or wayside shrine
- A guardian angel as the shopkeeper
- Healing through prayer and sacramentals
- Candles, incense, sacred imagery

### Items & Equipment
- Sacramentals: holy water, blessed candles, scapulars
- Rosary beads as accessories
- Relics of saints providing buffs
- Prayer books as "spell" sources

### Shrines & Healing
- Invoke specific saints for intercession
- Confession mechanic for cleansing/healing
- Prayers of the faithful (upgrade system?)
- Indulgences as special pickups

### Visual & Audio
- Shift from dark dungeon to purifying flames and growing light
- Stained glass motifs and iconography
- Sacred music: chant, polyphony, organ
- Incense particles, candle glow, holy fire

### Floor Themes
Potential progression through stages of purification:
1. Attachment to earthly things
2. Pride and vainglory
3. Envy and resentment
4. Wrath and unforgiveness
5. Sloth and spiritual apathy
6. Greed and avarice
7. The final purification

### The Ending
- Not a boss fight, but reaching the Light
- Union with God / entering Heaven
- Perhaps a vision of the Beatific Vision
- Reunion with the communion of saints

## Theological Grounding

- **Hope**: Purgatory is not despair—every soul there will reach Heaven
- **Purification, not punishment**: Suffering has redemptive purpose
- **Communion of Saints**: Prayers of the living aid the holy souls
- **Mercy**: God's mercy is the reason purgatory exists
- **Time**: Purgatory exists outside earthly time

## Implementation Notes

These changes should be gradual:
1. Start with subtle touches (candles, sacred imagery)
2. Rename elements to fit theme (floors → stages, enemies → trials)
3. Add prayer/intercession mechanics
4. Develop the seven sins as floor themes
5. Culminate in a heavenly ending
