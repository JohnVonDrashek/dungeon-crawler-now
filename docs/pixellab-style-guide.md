## Generation Order

For connected tilesets, generate in this order and chain base_tile_ids:

1. **Hub floor/wall** (base reference)
2. **Pride** - use hub as lower reference for portal transition
3. **Greed** - chain from Pride
4. **Wrath** - chain from Greed
5. **Sloth** - chain from Wrath
6. **Envy** - chain from Sloth
7. **Gluttony** - chain from Envy
8. **Lust** - chain from Gluttony

## Notes

- All tilesets should feel like they belong in the same game
- Dark base tones keep readability for gameplay
- Sin-specific accents provide visual distinction
- Consistent "worn ancient dungeon" aesthetic ties everything together
- 16x16 tiles match existing game assets
